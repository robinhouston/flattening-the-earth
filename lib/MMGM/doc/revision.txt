Changes to the Meshmerizing Mesh Maker Macros package:

2002/10/23
makemesh.inc  : added the option to write Wavefront '*.obj'files, compressed
                mesh '*.pcm' files and '*.arr' files containing arrays for
                building a mesh2().
                Added CheckFileName(FileName) macro. This is also used by all
                other include files in the package.

param.inc &   : the texture for uv_mapping is now taken from the square <0,0>-
twovar.inc      <1,1> instead of from the rectangle <UVmin>-<UVmax>. This may
                break exiting scenes :(

all inc files : checking wether or not to build a mesh or parse it from a file
                is now done via the CheckFileName() macro in makemesh.inc.

2002/10/20
param.inc     : split the original Parametric() macro into two. Parametric() and
                Paramcalc(). The first is now a frontend to the latter.
                Paramcalc() does all the hard work. It can be used directly.
                This to make it possible to use macros instead of functions as
                the base for a parametric surface.

2002/09/29
p_steiner.pov : replaced some ^ by pow(), these were leftovers from the
                the POV-Ray 3.5 beta-phase.

2002/09/01
makemesh.inc  : changed the write sequences, so it will write a big number
                like 1002001 as 1002001 and not as 1.002e+006. The latter
                will make a mess when parsing a mesh from file.

2002/08/28
prism.inc     : replaced some ^ by pow(), these were leftovers from the
                the POV-Ray 3.5 beta-phase.

2002/07/25
param.inc     : fixed an error of the normal calculation near
                the edges of an object. (Umin & Vmin)
